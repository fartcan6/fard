# F4RD

F4RD is a simple command-line tool that creates a folder and a README.txt file inside it. The README.txt file contains the text "trolled". This tool was created as a prank to "troll" people who were trying to install something else, but it can also be used as a simple demonstration of how to create folders and files using a bash script.

# INSTALLATION

To install F4RD, you can run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fartcan6/fard.git && cd fard && ./stuff/fard.sh --install
```
This will clone the F4RD repository from GitHub and run the installation script. The installation script will create a folder named "fard" in your home directory and create a README.txt file inside it with the text "trolled".How to run it

# HOW TO RUN IT
• Open your terminal (command prompt on Windows) and navigate to the directory 
where you cloned the fard repository.

• Navigate to the stuff directory using the command: cd stuff.

• Run the fard.sh script by typing: ./fard.sh --install.

• Follow the instructions that appear on your screen to complete the installation process.

**Note: The installation process requires an internet connection to clone the fard repository from GitHub. The installation script is compatible with macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems.**

# COMPATIBILITY

F4RD is compatible with macOS, Linux, and Windows. It requires a bash shell to run, which is available by default on macOS and Linux. On Windows, you can install the Git Bash shell (included with Git for Windows) or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to run the tool.
